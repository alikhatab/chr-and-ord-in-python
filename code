in this file I wrote about how to code a text to something else. This is very powerfull tool to 
do that. 

these are many example about that. The for loop is doing a great work here. Please back when you need 
  in this example you can make the coding letters very esaily 

 for bokstav in ('LinLin Epm! Ry lev nek wovmzmx qmr ovötxivmrkwepksvmxq wb nek oer womgoe liqpmke qihhiperhir xmpp Hmk! Oyp exx Hy lev pögoexw hiovötxive hix! Fve nsffex!'):
 #print(chr(ord(bokstav) - 4))


    
 for bokstav in ("vi ses"):
 print(chr(ord(bokstav) + 5 ))



for bokstav in ("ofl  {nqq yfhpf inl {n xjx"):

    print(chr(ord(bokstav) - 5 ))

for char in string:
print(char)
